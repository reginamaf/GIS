# GIS
# Strider's Challenge API
This is my solution for Strider`s application challenge.

## Enviroment configuration

The requirements for this application can be found in "requirements.txt". To install all the dependencies run:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

As an alternative, you can use the virtual environment "env", that is fully configured. To use it, activate the environment using:

`env/bin/activate`

To execute the application, run:

`python app.py`

## Implementation strategy

GDAL and numpy libraries from Python were used to extract and manipulate the information from the image.

## Documentation

The documentation was made using swagger UI and can be accessed in:

`<local_host>/swagger`
